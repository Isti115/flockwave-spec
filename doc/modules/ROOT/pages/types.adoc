= Data types used in messages

This section describes the complex data types and structures that are
used in Flockwave messages. These data types will be referenced later
from the *Known message types* section.

== Timestamps

Timestamps MUST always be expressed as the number of milliseconds elapsed since
the Unix epoch (1970-01-11 00:00:00 UTC. Note that this means that timestamps
expressed in local time MUST be converted to UTC before expressing them as milliseconds.

== Dates and times as strings

image:http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/iso_8601.png[The preferred date and
time format of Flockwave]

Dates, times and durations MUST always be expressed in UTC using an
appropriate http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601.htm[ISO 8601]
format (see also https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339[RFC 3339],
especially section 5.6 if you don’t like paywalls). Unless stated
otherwise, the following formats should be used:

* Dates should be expressed as _YYYY_-_MM_-_DD_ (ISO 8601 extended
format).
* Times should be expressed as __HH__:__mm__:__ss__.__sss__ (ISO 8601 extended
format). The millisecond part may be omitted if not relevant.
* Dates and times should be expressed as the date, followed by a literal
`T`, followed by the time, followed by `Z`, where the `T` is the
standard ISO 8601 separator between dates and times, and `Z` is the ISO
8601 marker for UTC (Zulu time).

== Angles

Angles are always expressed in degrees because radians are for
mathematicians. Depending on the context, angles may either be expressed
in the half-open interval [0, 360), or in the half-open interval [-180,
180) or [-90, 90). For instance, latitudes, longitudes, roll and pitch
are naturally expressed in an interval centered around zero, while
heading and yaw information is typically presented as a non-negative
number. When in doubt, look at the formal JSON schema specification for
the allowed range of an angle.

NOTE: Even though it is common in aviation to indicate 360 degrees
instead of zero degree, we always transmit zero degree instead of 360
degrees in messages because it comes naturally from the way computers
handle modulo arithmetics. The user interface may still opt to present
zero degree as 360 degrees if the user prefers that.

However, when encoding an angle, it is first quantized in 1/10th of degrees
and then encoded as a signed or unsigned integer in order to avoid floating
point related inaccuracies and the accumulation of quantization errors
(see discussion about xref:appendix/floating-point.adoc[floating-point
inacccuracies]). Therefore, the typical range of angles is [0, 3600) or
[-1800, 1800), both of which are well versed to fit in a 16-bit integer.

== Byte arrays

The JSON format does not support the transmission of raw byte arrays
directly since the JSON string type is a sequence of Unicode characters
and not a sequence of raw bytes. When a raw byte array has to be
transmitted in JSON, the typical solution is to send a base64-encoded
representation as a string (see
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648[RFC4648]). This representation is
approximately 33% longer than the corresponding raw byte array, but is
still much shorter than the representation of the byte array as a JSON
array of integers.

== `Attitude`

An `Attitude` object describes the orientation of a UAV using the
standard roll, pitch and yaw angles. See the section about
<<_angles,angles>> for more information about how the angles are
expressed.

The object is stored as a list with three mandatory items.

*Items*

[cols="1,1,1,7",options="header",]
|===
|Index | Required? |Type |Description
|0 |yes |<<_angles,angle>> |the roll angle in degrees, in the range
[-900, 900)

range [-900, 900)

|2 |yes |<<_angles,angle>> |the yaw angle in degrees, in the range
[0, 3600)
|===

== `ChannelOperation`

Enumeration type that describes the possible operations that may be
performed on a channel of a device (real or virtual) on a UAV. See
xref:devices.adoc[Objects, devices and channels] for more information.
Currently the following values are defined:

`read`:: Represents the act of reading the current value of the
channel.

`write`:: Represents the act of writing a new value to the channel.

== `ChannelType`

Enumeration type that describes the possible types of channels of a
device (real or virtual) on a UAV. See xref:devices.adoc[UAV devices and
channels] for more information. Currently the following values are
defined:

`audio`:: A channel that provides a URL to an audio stream.

`boolean`:: A channel that provides a single Boolean value

`bytes`:: A channel that provides an array of raw bytes.

`color`:: A channel that provides a color in 8-bit RGB, RGBA or RGBW
format. The color is typically expressed as an array of three or four
bytes, each byte ranging from 0 to 255.

`duration`:: A channel that provides the duration of a time window,
expressed as the number of seconds elapsed since the start of the time
window. Fractional seconds are allowed.

`number`:: A channel that provides a single double-precision
floating-point number.

`object`:: A channel that provides a complex JSON object.

`string`:: A channel that provides a UTF-8 encoded string.

`time`:: A channel that provides a time instant, expressed as the
number of seconds elapsed since the UNIX epoch in UTC. Fractional
seconds are allowed.

`video`:: A channel that provides a URL to a video stream.

== `ClockEpoch`

A `ClockEpoch` object describes the epoch of a clock or timer that the
Flockwave server manages. It is either a numeric <<_timestamps,timestamp>>,
a <<_dates_and_times_as_strings_as_strings,datetime>> string or one of the
following string values:

`unix`:: The UNIX epoch, i.e. midnight on 1 Jan 1970 UTC.

[#clock-info]
== `ClockInfo`

A `ClockInfo` object describes the current state of a clock or timer
that the Flockwave server manages (e.g., a clock that reports the local
time, the GPS time or a MIDI timecode coming from an external MIDI
device connected to the server).

*Fields*

[width="100%",cols="15%,10%,25%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Required? |Type |Description
|id |yes |string |the unique identifier of the clock

|epoch |no |<<_clockepoch,ClockEpoch>> |the epoch from which the
current timestamp of the clock is to be measured, if that makes sense
for the clock. When the epoch is omitted, the clock is assumed to be
ticking since an unspecified instant in the past.

|retrievedAt |yes |<<_timestamps,timestamp>> |the time according
to the internal clock server when the state of the clock was retrieved.
If the internal clock of the server and the client is synchronized, this
can be used by the client to compensate for the time it takes for the
server to transmit the clock status message to the client.

|running |yes |boolean |whether the clock is running at the moment

|ticksPerSecond |no |float |the number of clock ticks per second. Must
be larger than zero. When omitted, it is assumed to be equal to 1.

|ticks |yes |float |the number of ticks that have elapsed on the clock
|===

[source,json]
----
{
    "id": "mtc",
    "ticks": 4221,

    "ticksPerSecond": 30,
    "running": true
}
----

[#colorrgb565]
== `ColorRGB565`

A `ColorRGB565` object is essentially a single integer in the range 0 to 65535
such that the most significant 5 bits encode the red component of an RGB color,
the least significant 5 bits encode the blue component, and the remaining 6
bits in the middle encode the green component. This data type is used when some
color information has to be transmitted in a way that does not occupy too much
space in the message, assuming that the exact color is not too important as
there is some quantization error when converting a 24-bit RGB color into
RGB565 representation.

== `CommandExecutionStatus`

A `CommandExecutionStatus` object describes the execution status of a
command that was relayed from a client to a UAV by the server.

*Fields*

[width="100%",cols="15%,10%,25%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Required? |Type |Description
|sent |yes |<<_timestamps,timestamp>> |time when the command
request was sent to the UAV

|acknowledged |no |<<_timestamps,timestamp>> |time when the UAV
acknowledged the receipt of the request (explicitly or implicitly,
i.e. by sending a status update or a response)

|updated |no |<<_timestamps,timestamp>> |time when the UAV updated
the progress of the request (explicitly or implicitly, i.e. by sending
the completed response)

|finished |no |<<_timestamps,timestamp>> |time when the final
response was fully received by the server

|progress |no |float |the progress of the execution of the command,
expressed as an integer value between 0 and 100 (inclusive)
|===

*Example*

[source,json]

    "sent": 1459670842000,
    "acknowledged": 1459670842471,
    "updated": 1459670842811,
    "progress": 80,
}
----

== `CommandResponse`

A `CommandResponse` object stores the response given by a particular UAV
to a command sent to it using a `CMD-REQ` request, along with a type
annotation that tells the receiver how the response should be
interpreted.

Currently the Flockwave protocol defines the following response types:

`plain`:: Plain text response that should be formatted on the receiver
side as is.

`markdown`:: Markdown-formatted text response that should be
interpreted by a Markdown processor before it is displayed to the
user.

Additional response types may be defined by the user as needed.

*Example*

[source,json]
----
{
    "type": "markdown",
    "data": "# Heading\n\nHello world!"
}
----

== `ConnectionInfo`

A `ConnectionInfo` object describes the purpose and current state of a
connection that the Flockwave server manages (e.g., a radio link or a
DGPS stream).

*Fields*

[width="100%",cols="15%,10%,25%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Required? |Type |Description
|id |yes |string |the unique identifier of the connection

    "purpose": "uavRadioLink",
    "description": "Upstream XBee radio link",
    "status": "connected",
    "timestamp": 1449562061000
}
----

== `ConnectionPurpose`

Enumeration type that describes the purpose of a connection. Currently
the following values are defined:

`debug`:: A connection that is meant for debugging purposes only.

`dgps`:: A connection whose purpose is to receive DGPS or RTK correction
packets from an external stream (e.g., an NTRIP data source or a
serial link to an RTK base station).

`dock`:: A connection that provides information about the status of a
docking station.

`gps`:: A connection that receives data from a GPS device.

`time`:: A connection whose purpose is to connect to a service or
device that provides time-related information. Examples are connections
to an NTP server or a MIDI timecode provider.

`uavRadioLink`:: A connection whose purpose is to receive status
information from UAVs and/or send commands to them.

`other`:: A connection whose purpose does not fit into the above
categories. It is advised to use a human-readable description for these
connections.

== `ConnectionStatus`

Enumeration type that describes the possible states of a connection. A
connection may be in exactly one of the following five states at any
time:

`disconnected`:: The connection is not alive and no connection attempt
is currently in progress.

`connecting`:: The connection is not alive yet, but a connection or
reconnection attempt is currently in progress.

`connected`:: The connection is alive.

`disconnecting`:: The connection is not alive any more, but it has not
been properly shut down yet.

`unknown`:: The status of the connection is unknown (typically because
we have received no status information from the connection yet).

The value of a field of type `ConnectionStatus` is always a string with
one of the five values above.

== `DeviceClass`

Enumeration type that describes the possible classes (i.e. types) of
devices in a device tree. Device classes may be used by user interfaces
talking to a Flockwave server to provide some feedback to the user about
the type of a device (e.g., it could show batteries with a different
icon). Currently the following values are registered:

`accelerometer`:: The device is an accelerometer.

`actuator`:: The device is a generic actuator that cannot be
categorised more precisely into any of the other classes.

`altimeter`:: The device is an altimeter (e.g., pressure sensor, radar
altimeter, sonic altimeter).

radio).

`rc`:: The device is an RC receiver.

`rotor`:: The device is a rotor.

`sensor`:: The device is a generic sensor that cannot be categorised
more precisely into any of the other classes.

`speaker`:: The device is a speaker.

== `DeviceTreeNode`

This type represents a single node of the device tree. The node may
represent a UAV or any other top-level object that has a unique ID, an
onboard (real or virtual) device of an object, or a channel of a device.
(See xref:devices.adoc[Objects, devices and channels] for more details).

*Fields*

[width="100%",cols="15%,10%,25%,50%",options="header",]

|type |yes |<<_devicetreenodetype,`DeviceTreeNodeType`>> |The type of
the node

|subType |no |<<_channeltype,`ChannelType`>> |The type of the channel
if the node is a channel node. This field is required for channel nodes
and forbidden for other types of nodes.

|class |no |<<_deviceclass,`DeviceClass`>> |The type of the device
that this node represents. This field is optional for device nodes and
forbidden for other types of nodes. Its value may be used by Flockwave
clients to represent the device in a different way on the UI or to hide
certain types of devices.

|children |no |object of <<_evicetreenode,`DeviceTreeNode`>> |Object
mapping names of child nodes to their descriptions

|operations |no |list of <<_channeloperation,`ChannelOperation`>> |The
list of operations supported by the channel. This field is required for
channel nodes and forbidden for other types of nodes.

|unit |no |string |The unit in which the value of the channel is
represented. This field is optional for channel nodes (typically makes
sense for numeric channels) and forbidden for other types of nodes.
|===

== `DeviceTreeNodeType`

Enumeration type that describes the type of a device tree node (see
<<_devicetreenode,`DeviceTreeNode`>>. Currently the following values
are defined:

`root`:: This is the root node of the device tree. The node has no
parent by definition. The children of the root node must be nodes of
type `object`.

`object`:: This is a tree node that represents an object that is identified
by its ID in the server. The parent of an `object` node is always a `root`
node. The children of the object nodes must be nodes of type `device`.

`device`:: This is a tree node that represents a device of an object, or a
sub-device of another device. The parent of a `device` node is either a
`uav` node or another `device` node.

`channel`:: This is a tree node that represents a channel of a device.
The parent of a `channel` node is always a `device` node.

== `ErrorList`

This type is simply an array of numbers, where each number represents a
possible error condition. See xref:errors.adoc[Error codes] for a
detailed listing of all the error codes that are currently defined in
the Flockwave protocol.

== `GPSCoordinate`

This type represents a coordinate given by a GPS in the usual
"latitude, longitude, altitude above mean sea level, altitude above
ground level" format using the WGS84 reference system.

Latitude and longitude should be specified with at least seven digits'
precision if possible. (More than seven digits is usually not necessary
because consumer GPS receivers are not that accurate). To avoid floating point
inaccuracies, latitudes and longitudes are stored in 10^-7^ degrees, and altitudes
are stored in millimeters as integers.

The object is stored as a list with four items. The third and fourth items
(AMSL and AGL) may be null if they are not known. Trailing nulls may be omitted.

*Items*

[cols="1,1,1,7",options="header",]
|===
|Index |Required? |Type |Description
|0 |yes |float |The latitude, in 10^-7^ degrees, in the range [-90 × 10^7^, 90 × 10^7^)
|1 |yes |float |The longitude, in 10^-7^ degrees, in the range [-180 × 10^7^,180 × 10^7^)

== `ObjectType`

Enumeration type that describes the possible object types that the server
knows about. See xref:devices.adoc[Objects, devices and channels] for more
information.

Currently the following values are defined:

`beacon`:: A beacon on the ground or in the air. May also be used for waypoints
that do not have a physical presence.

`dock`:: A docking station.

`other`:: Other object type, not listed here.

`uav`:: An unmanned aerial vehicle.

`weatherStation`:: A weather station.

Values not listed here should also be accepted by the server. If the server
does not know a particular object type, it should simply return an empty list
when the user queries about objects of an unknown type. This allows server
extensions to register custom object types later on.

== `Severity`

Enumeration type that describes the severity level of a human-readable message
that the server sends to the client.

Currently the following values are defined:

`debug`:: Debug messages that are of interest to developers only.

`info`:: Informational messages.

`warning`:: Warning messages.

`error`:: Error messages.

`critical`:: Critical errors that require immediate attention.

== `UAVStatusInfo`

currently applicable for the UAV. When omitted, it means that there are
no errors.

|debug |no |<<_byte_arrays,byte array>> |Debug information provided by
the algorithm running on the UAV (if applicable).

*Example*

[source,json]

The debug information in the above example is then decoded to `0BADCAFE`
using base64.

== `VelocityNED`

This type represents the velocity of an airborne object (typically a
UAV) in the NED coordinate system (also called local tangent plane). The
default unit for the components is mm/s (millimeters per second). For
instance, a UAV moving northeast with ~2.82 m/s (2.82 = sqrt(8)) while
ascending with 1 m/s is expressed by a velocity vector where north=2000,
east=2000 and down=-1000.
