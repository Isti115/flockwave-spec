= Message types

This section is an exhaustive reference of all the mandatory message types
supported by the Flockwave protocol. Flockwave server implementations MUST
provide message handlers for these messages. Future versions of the specification
might demote some of these messages from mandatory to optional.

The examples provided in this
section contain the message body only; each body object must be wrapped
by an appropriate xref:general.adoc#_the_envelope_of_a_message[message envelope].
