= `DOCK` â€” Docking station related messages

Docking stations are subtypes of objects and thus exist in the same namespace as
all other objects in the server. The messages listed in this section are specific
to docking stations and do not apply to other object types.

== `DOCK-INF` - Basic status information of one or more docking stations.

A client sends this request to the server to obtain basic status
information about one or more docking stations currently known to the server.
