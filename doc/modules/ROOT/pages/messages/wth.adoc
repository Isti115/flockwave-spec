= `WTH` â€” Weather station related messages

Weather stations use a combination of instruments to provide basic measurements
about the current weather and also to provide short-term forecasts. The messages
listed in this section are specific to weather stations and do not apply to
other object types.

== `WTH-AT` - Current weather at a given geograpical coordinate.

A client sends this request to the server to obtain information about the current
weather at the given geographical coordinate. If there is no weather station at
the given coordinate, the server MAY use data from the nearest weather station,
interpolate information from multiple nearby weather stations, or turn to an
externa service such as OpenWeatherMap to provide weather data at the given
location.

The response contains an object of type xref:types.adoc#_weather[`Weather`].
Weather objects provide a `position` field; this may or may not be identical
to the position in the request. When the position is identical, it indicates that
the weather object was interpolated from nearby weather stations or that there
was an exact match for the given coordinate. When the position is not identical,
it indicates that the weather object was obtained from a single nearby weather
station, and the position shows the coordinate of the weather station.
