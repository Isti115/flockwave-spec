= Introduction

This document describes *Flockwave*, the communication protocol used in the
*Skybrush* ecosystem between the server component and the connected clients.

*Flockwave* is a http://json.org/[JSON]-based communication protocol in
https://collmot.com[CollMot Robotics]â€™s distributed UAV flock system that
allows multiple ground control consoles (clients) and tailor-made third-party
applications to monitor and control an airborne flock of UAVs via a central
ground station (server).

The document outlines the key actors in the system and specifies the
communication protocol in detail. The document assumes familiarity with
http://json.org/[JSON] and standard networking concepts such as TCP
streams, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and WebSockets. Details
of the http://json.org/[JSON] format can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt[RFC 4627] and
http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf[ECMA
404].
