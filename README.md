Flockwave protocol specification
================================

This repository contains the documentation of the Flockwave communication
protocol in [CollMot Robotics][1]'s distributed UAV flock system that allows
multiple ground control consoles (clients) to monitor and control an airborne
flock of UAVs via a central ground station (server).

The ``doc`` folder contains a human-readable documentation of the protocol.
Formal [JSON Schema][2] specifications of most of the message that are used
in the protocol are stored in the ``schema`` folder.
